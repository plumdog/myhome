A while ago, I wrote my first Django migration that actually mattered,
and was a data migration rather than a nice, simple, auto generated
one for adding columns. I am of the view that migrations are
scary. Especially data migrations, where you're shuffling data around
in your tables. If you're scared about something being wrong, then
right a test; and so I found
[this](https://micknelson.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/testing-django-migrations/).

The post describes a TestCase subclass that sets the database to a
starting migration state, lets you add some data, run the migrations
through to a new state, then assert things about how the data now
looks. This seems like an excellent way to gain some confidence that
your migrations mutates your data in the correct way. However, the
linked article assumes South migrations are being used, so is no help
for Django>=1.7, which is why I wrote
[django_migration_test](https://github.com/plumdog/django_migration_test),
which aims to work with Django's new migrations framework.

I'm keen to find out if it actually works in various edge cases and
database engines. I also want to know if this is actually a solved
problem, or if this is not the best way of testing in this case. It's
[on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-migration-test/), and
you can install it with

`pip install django-migration-test`

and then write a test that looks a bit like:

```python
from django_migration_test import MigrationTest


class MyMigrationTest(MigrationTest):

    # At present, we can only run migrations for one app at a time.
    app_name = 'my_app'
    # At present, these need to be full names of migrations, not just
    # prefixes.
    before = '0001_initial'
    after = '0002_change_fields'

    # Can have any name, is just a test method. MigrationTest
    # subclasses django.test.TestCase
    def test_migration(self):
        # Load some data. Don't directly import models. At this point,
        # the database is at self.before, and the models have fields
        # set accordingly.

        MyModel = self.get_model_before('MyModel')

        # ... save some models

        # Trigger the migration
        self.run_migration()

        # Now run some assertions based on what the data should now
        # look like. The database will now be at self.after. To run
        # queries via the models, reload the model.

        MyModel = self.get_model_after('MyModel')
```
