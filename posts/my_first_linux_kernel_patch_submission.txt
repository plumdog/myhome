So, I don't really know much more than the basics of C -- though I
rather hope that will soon change -- but since having my first
pull-request on GitHub accepted back in May, contributing to the Linux
Kernel seemed like a reasonable next step.

The Linux Kernel is an enormous body of code. Somewhere in the region
15 million lines of C and Assembly. Development is not driven by any
one company, and not even really by one organisation. The [Linux
Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) describes itself as

> a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux

It doesn't steer development, and to quote Linus

> Linux is evolution, not intelligent design

Its just a lot of developers submitting code to other developers, and
so on, until it reaches Linus at the top of the tree, and that's how
the Kernel happens. There are a lot of companies that do employ people
full-time to contribute, but anyone can if they are so inclined.

And I am. My first patch is just to tweak the format of some
documentation comments in the code to conform with the comment
style. Honestly, I don't even know what the file is for. I know its
for a driver, but no idea what that driver is for. But I don't need
to. The Kernel is updated often in tiny, easy to verify alterations,
and that's what I can (try to) provide.

My change is [here in all its glory](https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/29/477).

Let's hope there are more in the future.
