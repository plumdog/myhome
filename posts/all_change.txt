I recently made [All Change](https://allchange.herokuapp.com/) which
is for checking your train times when changing trains.

This is to scratch a personal itch about trying to decide which train
you are likely to connect with.

But most importantly, its a small, achievable project. It's only taken
2 days from first creating the repo to deploying to Heroku. This is in
stark contrast to my usual tendancy to attempt large open-ended
projects. So well done me for actually doing a thing.
