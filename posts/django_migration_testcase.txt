I recently released
[django_migration_testcase](https://github.com/plumdog/django_migration_testcase). This
isn't the first time that I've released a Python package - see
[flask_table](https://github.com/plumdog/flask_table) - but it is the
most complicated. And, specifically, complicated enough that it had
several serious bugs when I first put it on GitHub.

After opening up the code, and other people being able to poke about
with it I fixed two things that were downright broken - including the
installation from `pip` and PyPI just not working - and questions
about how to use it. While the code bugs could have been found by me,
the documentation and usability bugs would have virtually impossible
for me to find. It's so hard to identify which parts of your project
are unclear or easy to use incorrectly.

For this reason, focusing on the hurdles to new users for your project
is the best place to spend time, because the more you do it, the more
it is done for you. And if you neglect it, you're pulling up the
ladder stopping it from happening at all.
