This is my first Django project that has gone as far as an actual
server. Apart from the usual Apache based issues, it has been a
breeze.

Django has a much stronger idea of "the right way to do it" than
Flask, which is a blessing and a curse. It is my belief that Web
Development and the use of MVC frameworks can suffer from the curse of
the instrument: "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail". But, to extend this metaphor, there are certainly an awful lot
of nails and Django looks like a very good hammer.

I should probably start by tidying up this site. I hear that CSS and
things are important, so I might actually bother to do some of that.
