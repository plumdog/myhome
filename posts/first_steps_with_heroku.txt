So I've now deployed this site to Heroku. It was all pretty easy. A
few things to muddle through, and a few things that Heroku expects to
be a certain way, but its all easy enough to sort out and fix up.

I also managed to convert from Sqlite3 to Postgres. This was fairly
easy once I fiddled with the SQL, turning some ones and zeroes into
trues and falses, and removing the SQL that `manage.py migrate` will
already have run.
